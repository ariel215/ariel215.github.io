    <h2>Don't Let Your Dreams Be Dreams</h2>
<p>Not that the game discussed previously came to me in a dream, exactly, but you know.
Late night epiphanies might as well be dreams.</p>
<p>I'm going to make it in Rust because Rust is everything, its the future,
it has reached maturity and is hotter than buttered toast and I haven't <em>really</em>
had a major project to let me really learn how it works until now. Furthermore,
I want to solve some of the lower-level problems of implementing something like this.</p>
<h2>Step One: Copy the <code>miniquad</code> example code into the project</h2>
<hr />
<p>I did say <em>some</em> of the low-level problems. I've forgotten everything I
ever knew about how graphics actually works, so that's where we're going to start;
getting some tiles onto the screen.</p>
<p>...it works! Now to take this and refactor it into something I understand.</p>
<p>...oh. oh no. This is not what I want to use at all.</p>
<h2>Step Two: Remove the <code>miniquad</code> example code, add the <code>raylib</code> example code</h2>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a> is a small games-like library written in C. It has
a crate with Rust bindings. It doesn't assume I want to write shader code, and thus
seems like it will probably be a better choice. Its example is &quot;hello world&quot;, but
we can pretty get it to make a checkerboard pretty quickly!</p>

<p>Next up: Let's add some rhythm!</p>
