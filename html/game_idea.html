    <h2>An Idea for a Game</h2>
<p>This came to me late last night, so I want to write it down before I forget and
it vanishes into the Idea Void:</p>
<p>A puzzle platformer with movement a la Crypt of the Necrodancer.
Move and jump on the beat as tiles appear and disappear in
rhythmic patterns</p>
<p>Style: 3D isometric, glowing pastels or perhaps neons, simple geometric forms. Musically:
either a kind of light floating vaporwave or a stabby techno, matching the visuals</p>
<p>Length: ??? short. 15 minutes is 5-8 levels is probably as many as I can reasonably create.</p>
<p>Controls &amp; mechanics:</p>
<ul>
<li>WASD to move</li>
<li>Shift+WASD to jump</li>
<li>rhythm-based inputs</li>
</ul>
