    <p>Hi! I'm Ariel, as you probably know by now.
I'm primarily a Pythonista who has worked in
data science and data management, as a developer
with the <a href="http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/RAM">DARPA RAM PROJECT</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, I've been completing an M.S. in Computer Science
at Northwestern University, studying compilers/systems programming
on the one hand and game design and development on the other. I've
learned a lot about working with C# and the Unity engines, but
most of what I've done isn't quite in a state where I can share it publically...
alas.</p>
