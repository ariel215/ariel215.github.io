Contact Info

If you want to be in touch, the best way is via email: 
![l a d 2 5 8 @ c o r n e l l . e d u](../images/email.png)

I'm also on [Mark Zuckerberg's bad website](https://facebook.com/ariel.davis.215).

As you might have expected, my Github profile is [https://github.com/ariel215],
hence where this site is hosted.
