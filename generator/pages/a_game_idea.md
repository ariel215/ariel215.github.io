=======================

This came to me late last night, so I want to write it down before I forget and 
it vanishes into the Idea Void:

A puzzle platformer with movement a la Crypt of the Necrodancer.
Move and jump on the beat as tiles appear and disappear in 
rhythmic patterns

Style: 3D isometric, glowing pastels or perhaps neons, simple geometric forms. Musically:
either a kind of light floating vaporwave or a stabby techno, matching the visuals

Length: ??? short. 15 minutes is 5-8 levels is probably as many as I can reasonably create.

Controls & mechanics: 
- WASD to move
- Shift+WASD to jump
- rhythm-based inputs
