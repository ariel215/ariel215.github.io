About Me
--------

Hi! I'm Ariel, as you probably know by now. 
I'm primarily a Pythonista who has worked in 
data science and data management, as a developer
with the [DARPA RAM PROJECT](http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/RAM). 

More recently, I've been completing an M.S. in Computer Science
at Northwestern University, studying compilers/systems programming
on the one hand and game design and development on the other. I've 
learned a lot about working with C# and the Unity engines, but 
most of what I've done isn't quite in a state where I can share it publically...
alas.
